*THIS IS FOR THE 0x03. C - Debugging PROJECT*

This task consist of several tasks. The tasks are as follows:

TASK 0 - Multiple mains[0-main.c]
       	 In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
	 
TASK 1 - Like,comment,subscribe[1-main.c]
       	 Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

	      * Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count.
	      You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
	      * You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
TASK 2 - 0 > 972?[2-largest_number.c]
       	 This program prints the largest of three integers.
	 
TASK 3 - Leap year [3-print_remaining_days.c]
       	 This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
